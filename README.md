# 🛡️ NpmDiffWatch

**Catch malicious npm updates before they spread — with a cheap local model and rules anyone can write.**

> 🌐 **A community early-warning system for the npm supply chain.** The more people watching the release
> firehose, the sooner a compromised package gets caught — and reported for takedown. Cheap to run, simple
> to extend, and you don't need to be a security expert to help.

Supply-chain attacks on open-source packages are escalating: an attacker ships a compromised version of a
trusted package, and it's pulled into thousands of installs before anyone notices. Defending against that
shouldn't require a security budget or a SaaS subscription. NpmDiffWatch is an open-source (MIT) scanner
that watches the npm release firehose, statically reviews what changed in each new version, and alerts
you **before** a malicious update spreads — running on hardware you already have.

It's built for the community to **extend** and to **afford**: the per-release review runs on a **local,
open-source LLM** (no per-token bill), and detection logic is **plain YAML rules** anyone can contribute.

## ⚙️ How it works

```
new npm releases → diff against the prior version → community rules score the change
   → anything suspicious goes to a local LLM reviewer → you get alerted
```

State lives in a local SQLite database; nothing is hosted, and nothing leaves your machine except the
calls to the npm registry and the model endpoint you point it at.

## 💡 Why NpmDiffWatch

- **Cheap by design.** The reviewer is meant to run on a local open-source model — the only setup it has
  been tested against — so watching the whole firehose costs you compute, not API credits. Hosted and
  frontier APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, …) work too, but local keeps it free.
- **It never runs what it inspects.** Analyzed packages are *data, never code*: NpmDiffWatch downloads a
  `.tgz` into memory, reads the source statically, and discards it — no `npm install`, no build, no
  `require`, no `node`, no `eval`. Package bytes reach the model only as request-body text, never as a URL
  it fetches. [More ↓](#-run-it-safely)
- **Community rules, run safely.** Detection rules are pure structured data (YAML) evaluated by a matcher
  with no `eval`/`exec` — so you can run other people's rules without running their code. See
  [`rules/community/`](rules/community).

## 🚀 Get started — the easy way

Clone it, open your favorite agent harness (**Claude Code**, **opencode**, or similar), and give it one prompt:

> *"Install the dependencies and let's configure the API endpoint to use a local model and start polling."*

The agent handles setup and drives the polling loop; your local model does the reviews. That's the
two-tier idea in a nutshell — a frontier model can **orchestrate** while a cheap local model does the
**per-release review work**.

---

## 🛠️ Get started — by hand

No agent required. Plain commands poll the firehose and still use your local LLM for every review:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OffByQuant/npmDiffWatch npmdiffwatch && cd npmdiffwatch
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .                                # requires Python 3.11+

cp examples/local-qwen.toml npmdiffwatch.toml   # point at your local model endpoint
npmdiffwatch -c npmdiffwatch.toml seed-now      # start watching "from now"
npmdiffwatch -c npmdiffwatch.toml run           # process new releases (repeat on a schedule)
npmdiffwatch -c npmdiffwatch.toml pending       # see suspicious releases awaiting your verdict
npmdiffwatch -c npmdiffwatch.toml review-pending # review what the LLM couldn't (e.g. with a bigger model)
```

Prefer one command that scans continuously **and** shows you a live results page? Use the built-in daemon:

```bash
npmdiffwatch -c npmdiffwatch.toml watch --serve  # scan on a loop + serve the dashboard (↓)
```

Or drop `run` into a cron job, `systemd` timer, container, or CI schedule to monitor continuously. You can
also run with **no model at all** (rules-only heuristic alerts) when you have no GPU or budget.

## 🗄️ What it records

Everything lives in a single local SQLite database under `.diffwatch/` — nothing is hosted. It keeps a
**cursor** (how far through the npm registry's change stream you've scanned), one **releases** row per
version it processed (the diff basis, the triage score, and which rules fired), an **alerts** row per
notification sent, and a **verdicts** row with the reviewer's call — classification, confidence, attack
type, reasoning, and model — plus your own `human_label` once you adjudicate it (`pending` to review,
`adjudicate` to record).

A `releases` × `verdicts` slice from a real run (triage score is an unbounded sum of fired-rule weights;
the default escalation threshold is 40, so anything below it never reaches the reviewer):

```text
package  version  triage_score  attack_type       classification
-------  -------  ------------  ----------------  --------------
pkg-a    9.1.0          21135   install-hook-rce  malicious
pkg-b    2.9.32         16400   typosquat         malicious
pkg-c    0.7.2           5975   dropper           malicious
pkg-d    1.0.44          2510   typosquat         suspicious
pkg-e    3.13.0        167740   none              benign
```

*(Package names anonymized.)* The last row is why the LLM reviewer earns its place: a brand-new package can
rack up a huge heuristic score yet be correctly cleared as benign on inspection — catching the false
positive before it ever becomes an alert.

## 🖥️ See and act on the results

Finding a malicious release only matters if it gets reported and pulled. NpmDiffWatch turns the verdicts in
your database into a **local dashboard** — a single web page of cards, the dangerous ones sorted to the top,
each with a link straight to the package on npm and a one-click **"Report malware on npm"** button. The goal
is to make the path from *"the tool flagged this"* to *"reported for takedown"* as short as possible, so more
eyes lead to faster reporting and faster removal.

```bash
npmdiffwatch -c npmdiffwatch.toml watch --serve   # keep scanning + open a live dashboard
# → http://127.0.0.1:8787/dashboard.html
```

The page stays on your machine (it's served to `localhost` only by default — `--host 0.0.0.0` opts into
sharing it on your LAN) and runs no code from the packages it shows; every untrusted string is HTML-escaped.
**→ [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md#6-the-dashboard--the-watch-daemon)** for the details.

## 🔒 Run it safely

NpmDiffWatch ingests untrusted bytes from the npm registry and runs community-authored rules. The
no-execution design is the primary safeguard, but treat it as one layer: run it in a container, VM, or
unprivileged user with outbound network restricted to the npm registry, your model endpoint, and your
webhook — **not on a workstation that holds credentials or data you care about.** A built-in default-deny
egress allowlist (`npmdiffwatch/egress.py`) enforces this in-process; an OS-level boundary is what holds
if the process itself is ever compromised.

### The one hard invariant: no execution

Analyzed packages are never run. The `.tgz` is streamed and extracted **in memory** (never
`tarfile.extractall`, never written to disk), source is read statically via tree-sitter, and the bytes are
discarded. There is no `npm install`, no lifecycle-script execution, no `node`, no `require`, no `eval` of
package content anywhere in the pipeline. The download/extraction caps (`max_download_bytes`,
`max_member_bytes`, `max_total_bytes`, `max_decompressed_bytes`, …) bound how much of any tarball is ever
read into memory.

---

## 🧩 Bring your own rules

NpmDiffWatch ships a **basic starter set** of detection rules — enough to get you catching the obvious
attacks out of the box, not the last word. The rules live as plain YAML in the
[`rules/community/`](rules/community) folder (code, `package.json` fields, dependencies, lockfile,
maintainer, and binary signals), and the whole point is that **you extend them with your own**: structured
YAML over engine-provided facts, no code. If you can describe an attack pattern (say, "a base64 decode and
an `eval` in the same changed file", or "a `postinstall` script added to `package.json`"), you can add a
rule in a few minutes — drop another `.yaml` file in that folder and it's picked up automatically. The
loader is fail-closed: a malformed rule is rejected, never run as code.

---

## 🤝 Contributing & community

NpmDiffWatch gets stronger with scale: more people watching the firehose means malicious releases are
spotted sooner, and more shared rules means more attack patterns caught. You don't need to be a security
researcher or own a GPU to help.

- **Watch, and report what you catch.** Run it, and when a flagged release is genuinely malicious, report
  it to npm for takedown — the dashboard's one-click "Report malware on npm" button takes you straight
  there. Every extra watcher shortens the window an attacker has.
- **Write a rule.** If you can describe an attack pattern, you can add a YAML rule and open a pull request.
  See [`rules/community/`](rules/community) for the shipped rules to model yours on. No code, no `eval`.
- **Share a config or a fix.** Better example configs, clearer docs, and bug fixes are all welcome.

If you can clone a repo and edit a YAML file, you can contribute. That's the whole point.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Directions, not promises — contributions toward any of these are welcome:

- **Deeper binary inspection.** Go beyond flagging native addons (`.node`) and WebAssembly (`.wasm`) to
  analyzing what they do, so attacks shipped only in a compiled artifact don't slip past.
- **More alert destinations.** Additional notifier backends beyond the current webhook (e.g. email, chat).
- **A shared rule index.** Make it easy to discover, pull, and combine rule packs others have written.
- **A labeled evaluation set.** Measure detection precision/recall against known-malicious npm releases,
  so rule and weight changes can be scored instead of guessed.
- **Easier install.** A published package / `pipx` one-liner instead of an editable clone.
- **Resilient long runs.** Rate-limit-aware, resumable polling of the replication feed for unattended
  deployments.

## 🤖 Built with AI

NpmDiffWatch was developed with heavy use of AI coding agents (Claude Code) alongside the same kind of
local open-source models it runs on. The parts that matter most — the no-execution boundary, the
no-`eval` rule matcher, the egress allowlist — are human-reviewed and locked down by the containment test
suite, so AI assistance never gets to quietly weaken a security invariant.
